# skyspell core library

Note: although this crate is used by the 'skyspell' CLI and the 'skyspell_kak' wrapper, it has not yet
been used outside its monorepo, so not much has been documented.

Some starting points if you want to use `skyspell_core` in your project:

* The `examples` folder
* The `TokenProcess` and `EnchantDictionary` structs

Good luck, have fun !

# 2.0.0 (2024-10-15)

See [skyspell_core](https://github.com/your-tools/skyspell/blob/main/crates/core/Changelog.md#300-2024-10-15) changelog.

# 1.0.2 (2023-04-25)

* Bump `skyspell_core` to v2.0.0

# 1.0.1 (2022-11-12)

* Bump dependencies
* Update metadata

# 1.0.0 (2022-07-17)

## Changes in configuration files

See [skyspell_core](https://github.com/your-tools/skyspell/blob/main/crates/core/Changelog.md#100-2022-07-17) changelog.

## Changes in command-line syntax

The `--project-path` option must use right before the action.

Also, to add or ignore a rule for a project, use the boolean `--project` option

Before skyspell 1.0

```
# Add bar as a ignored word for the project in /path/to/foo
skyspell add --project-path /path/to/foo bar
# Add baz to the global ignore list:
skyspell add baz
```

After skyspell 1.0

```
# Add bar as a ignored word for the project in /path/to/foo
skyspell --project-path /path/to/bar add bar --project
# Add baz to the global ignore list:
skyspell --project-path add baz --project
```

In this version, the `skyspell-ignore.kdl` file in the current working
directory will be parsed, because we need to know if we need to store
baz in a sqlite or in the configuration file, which is why both
`--project-path` and `--project` need to be used.

# 0.8.1 (2022-03-12)

* Handle Python string prefixes, like in `f'input`

# 0.8.0 (2022-02-19)

## Breaking change: skip files using an ignore file

Remove "skip" features from the SQL repository and from the command line.

Instead of telling skyspell to skip `poetry.lock`, `Cargo.lock` and
`favicon.ico`, you can just create a file named `.skyspell-ignore` containing:

```
*.lock
favicon.ico
```

This makes the code much faster because we don't need to make a sql query for each
file we check, just when we find a spelling error.

This also means you can run `skyspell-check` without specifying the files to check:

```
# old:
$ skyspell check --project-path . $(git ls-files)
# new:
$ skyspell check --project-path .
```

Or even without specifying `--project-path` at all, which defaults to the
current working directory.

# 0.7.1 (2022-02-12)

* Remove `--aspell` option and `aspell` support. Additional complexity to avoid
  going through Enchant does not seems worth it.
* Tweak skyspell cli output

# 0.7.0 (2022-02-12)

* **Breaking** Split code into separate crates. This means you now need to install `skyspell_kak` in
  order to use the Kakoune integration.
* **Breaking** Remove `skyspell_underline_errors` option. We now use a specific SellingError face
  and users can change the default value if needed.

## Internal

* Use `kak_quoted_buflist` instead of `kak_buflist`
* Bump to clap 3.0
* Switch from `chrono` to `time`

# 0.6.1 (2021-11-01)

* Bump to Rust 2021 edition
* Fix splitting text in tokens when an abbreviation is in the middle of
  the identifier
* Fix when using latest Kakoune
* Improve error message when trying to spell check binary files

# 0.6.0 (2021-10-15)

* **Breaking**: The `SKYSPELL_DB_PATH` environment variable is no longer taken into account
* **Breaking**: Change syntax for kakoune integration:

```diff
  evaluate-commands %sh{
- skyspell kak init
+ skyspell-kak init  # < note the '-' instead of the space
  }
```

* Better error message when files contain invalid UTF-8 data
* Add option `skyspell_underline_errors` : to use curly underline red
  for spelling errors. Requires kakoune > 2021.08.28 (after
  [this commit](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/commit/3fc8e29d101b4f6eef2538cdbe799bab9859f4b3)

# 0.5.0 (2021-09-16)

* Implement "undo" for the interactive checker
* Improve performance
* Improve error handling
* Improve test coverage
* Properly parse "doesn't", "it's" and the like
* Fix bug regarding case sensitivity
* Be a bit more verbose when spell checking a project
* When trying to remove items from the repository, tell user if the item
  was already absent instead of silently doing nothing.

## Kakoune integration

* Add end-to-end testing using kitty's remote protocol and pytest
* Display errors in the status bar
* Display an error message when no suggestions are found
* Tell user when they are calling `suggest` and the selection is not an error
* Tell user when the selection is blank
* Add `undo` hook for the `*spelling*` buffer

# 0.4.0 (2021-06-15)

## Add support for projects

* File paths are now relative to the project root
* You can ignore words for a given project instead of globally

# 0.3.0 (2021-06-12)

* Allow to unskip paths and file names
* Better handling of `\` in source files

## Kakoune integration

* Use `a` to add to global ignore instead of `g` (it breaks `ga`)
* Check all open buffers, not just the current one
* Implement `next` and `previous`
* Use a `kak` subcommand instead of guessing whether we are called
  from Kakoune.

# 0.2.1 (2021-05-28)

Fix project metadata

# 0.2.0 (2021-05-28)

* Allow adding words to a global ignore list or by extension
* Add a non-interactive mode
* Allow to skip file names or file paths
* Check for good words with Enchant
* Support languages other than English
* Add support for suggestions
* Add Kakoune integration

# 0.1.0 (2021-05-18)

Initial release
